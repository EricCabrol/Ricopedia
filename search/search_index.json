Active sensors emit energy (e.g. Radio Waves or Laser light) and measure the reflected or scattered signal, while passive sensors detect the natural radiation or emission from the target or the environment (e.g. Sunlight or artificial light for Cameras). Each sensing modality has its advantages and inconveniences. As active sensors generate their own signals, external lighting conditions do not affect them. Both Radar and LiDAR function perfectly in total darkness and in direct sunlight, which is not the case for Cameras. Beyond night vision, the impact of external lighting on cameras has far-reaching consequences. For instance, Computer Vision algorithms may fail in areas with shadows caused by objects (moving or static e.g. trees or buildings) and even in indoor settings when lighting conditions change (e.g., a door opening adding more light to the scene). Weather conditions can significantly affect passive sensors since their sensing doesn\u2019t directly interact with physical phenomena like rain or fog. Instead, they can only work with the resulting image, making them more susceptible to weather-related limitations. However, active sensors can also be affected by adverse conditions, depending on their wavelength. Tough conditions Bright light or night scene Since the camera passively acquires visible light, its perception performance is greatly affected by changes in outside light. When encountering bright light at the tunnel exit, the camera\u2019s performance will be significantly affected, making it challenging to identify the road conditions, thus providing the smart car with limited perception information.

Each sensing modality has its advantages and inconveniences. As active sensors generate their own signals, external lighting conditions do not affect them. Both Radar and LiDAR function perfectly in total darkness and in direct sunlight, which is not the case for Cameras. Beyond night vision, the impact of external lighting on cameras has far-reaching consequences. For instance, Computer Vision algorithms may fail in areas with shadows caused by objects (moving or static e.g. trees or buildings) and even in indoor settings when lighting conditions change (e.g., a door opening adding more light to the scene). Weather conditions can significantly affect passive sensors since their sensing doesn\u2019t directly interact with physical phenomena like rain or fog. Instead, they can only work with the resulting image, making them more susceptible to weather-related limitations. However, active sensors can also be affected by adverse conditions, depending on their wavelength.","title":"Active vs passive sensors"},{"location":"AD%20ADAS%20sensors/#tough-conditions","text":"","title":"Tough conditions"},{"location":"AD%20ADAS%20sensors/#bright-light-or-night-scene","text":"Since the camera passively acquires visible light, its perception performance is greatly affected by changes in outside light.

Simulation platforms Subsystems Fidelity AVOps Autonomous Vehicle Operations Concept introduced by Microsoft ? Large-scale Data Operations Platform for Autonomous Vehicles (03/2023) This article highlights how we approached some of the concerns and constraints when developing a cloud-based data processing solution for AVOps (Autonomous Vehicle Operations). We aligned our solution with Microsoft\u2019s AVOps reference architecture . This provides a comprehensive set of cloud, edge, vehicle, and AI services that enable an integrated, end-to-end workflow for developing, verifying, and improving automated driving functions. We needed to be able to process a large amount of data collected for building and training ML models for Autonomous Vehicles. Basically, we needed a scalable and cost-effective solution to be able to deal with potentially petabytes of data. The data was collected from test vehicles going around the city and were in the Rosbag file format. A Rosbag, or bag, is a file format in ROS for storing ROS message data. Rosbag is an effective way to store all the collected sensor data in a format that can be easily used. Each Rosbag could range from 2-10 GB in size. Each vehicle would collect a maximum of 100 TB of data. After collection, this data will be uploaded to Azure for further processing.

Representational state transfer (REST) is a style of software architecture. RESTful is typically used to refer to web services implementing such an architecture. REST ( RE presentational S tate T ransfer) is basically an architectural style of development having some principles: - It should be stateless - It should access all the resources from the server using only URI - It does not have inbuilt encryption - It does not have session - It uses one and only one protocol - HTTP - For performing CRUD operations, it should use HTTP verbs such as get , post , put and delete - It should return the result only in the form of JSON or XML, atom, OData etc. (lightweight data ) REST based services follow some of the above principles and not all RESTFUL services means it follows all the above principles.

It emerges as a comprehensive and versatile API client suitable for enterprise-level development. Its support for a wide range of protocols, robust feature set, and strong performance make it a top choice for complex projects. With an intuitive design, collaboration features, and a large community, Postman excels in scenarios requiring extensive functionality and community support. Insomnia is a powerful API client with extensive features and being completely open-source makes it a good choice for developers seeking flexibility and continuous growth. Insomnia is suited for those who value an open-source environment and an active community. ReadyAPI , with its simplicity and focus on smaller projects, is an ideal choice for scenarios where a lightweight and responsive tool is preferred. It provides essential features, making it suitable for projects with less complexity. However, it may not be the best fit for larger, more intricate endeavors that require extensive functionality. ThunderClient , a VS Code plugin, is free and user-friendly, catering to developers who prefer an integrated testing environment. However, it lacks extensive features and community support, crucial for larger or complex projects, rendering it more appropriate for smaller teams with simpler requirements. Additionally, its reliance on Visual Studio Code may restrict its appeal to users who prefer alternative development environments.

An algebraic modeling language is a tool that simplifies the translation between the algebraic form of the modeler, and the standard form of the solver. Each algebraic modeling language has two main parts: A domain specific language for the user to write down problems in algebraic form. A converter from the algebraic form into a standard form supported by the solver (and back again). Examples - Pyomo is a collection of #Python packages, open-source under BSD license - CasADi , developed by KU Leuven, open-source, written in C++ with Python or [[Octave]] wrappers - Gekko - JuMP embedded in Julia Acado vs Casadi https://groups.google.com/g/casadi-users/c/Z_zu8hqTR3A/m/DuL-vG0kBwAJ (Joel Andersson, 02/2017) ACADO is a tool especially for NMPC implementing a structure exploiting SQP solver. It was developed in the same group as CasADi (with Moritz Diehl, then in Leuven, Belgium), but the scope is different. Whereas ACADO targets very fast NMPC for small to medium size systems with a tailored optimization method, CasADi is a much more general purpose optimization framework (...) Now, most people use CasADi not to implement direct multiple shooting, but direct collocation. And for direct collocation, with e.g. IPOPT as your NLP solver, CasADi is very fast. So it's more of a question of whether direct multiple shooting or direct collocation is a better approach for your problem. In general, I would expect CasADi (and direct collocation/IPOPT) to win out over ACADO for systems that are (1) larger, more than 20 state variables or so, (2) have a non-quadratic cost function, afaik ACADO only does Gauss-Newton SQP, not exact Hessian (3) problems with a lot of sparsity in the model equations, and (4) many problems with long time horizon.

Each algebraic modeling language has two main parts: A domain specific language for the user to write down problems in algebraic form. A converter from the algebraic form into a standard form supported by the solver (and back again).

(06/2024) https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/here-come-inferencing-asics-nick-hume-rbtfc/ (04/2024) Before exploring the specific ASIC innovations, it is helpful to understand how they compare to General Processing Units (GPUs), which are commonly used for AI tasks: Design Purpose : ASICs are custom-built for specific tasks, such as AI inferencing, making them highly efficient for those operations. In contrast, GPUs are more versatile and are designed to handle a variety of computational tasks, including graphics rendering and scientific computations. Performance and Efficiency : ASICs often deliver higher performance and greater power efficiency for specific AI tasks compared to GPUs. This is because ASICs eliminate unnecessary functionality, optimizing their architecture for particular AI algorithms. Flexibility : While GPUs offer greater flexibility and are suitable for a range of tasks, this comes at the cost of reduced efficiency for specific applications. ASICs, however, are not flexible but excel in the tasks they are designed for. Cost and Development Time : Developing ASICs requires more time and resources upfront due to the need for custom design and fabrication. GPUs, being mass-produced for a broader market, often come with lower individual costs and are readily available. Will ASICs Dethrone GPUs for LLM Inference ? (07/2024) In crypto mining, the initial reliance on GPUs and FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) gave way to the rise of ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) from China, which eventually took over due to their superior efficiency and performance for specific algorithms. Could we be on the cusp of a similar revolution in AI Inference hardware? LPU LPU Groq Language Processing Units https://groq.com/inference/ The LPU is fundamentally different from a GPU, which was originally designed for graphics processing. - Groq Compiler is in control, not secondary to hardware - Compute and memory are co-located on the chip, eliminating resource bottlenecks - Kernel-less compiler makes it easy and fast to compile new models - No caches and switches means seamless scalability https://www.comptoir-hardware.com/actus/business/47404-ia-groq-et-ses-lpu-pourraient-bien-venir-gacher-la-fete-de-nvidia-et-autres-vendeurs-de-gpu-.html \ud83c\uddeb\u200d\ud83c\uddf7 (02/2024) Ceci permet d\u2019une part d\u2019embarquer une m\u00e9moire qui fonctionne a 80 To/s, en comparaison du 1 To/s sur une RTX 4090 ou encore 1,7 To/s sur une H100 en HBM3.

(06/2024) https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/here-come-inferencing-asics-nick-hume-rbtfc/ (04/2024) Before exploring the specific ASIC innovations, it is helpful to understand how they compare to General Processing Units (GPUs), which are commonly used for AI tasks: Design Purpose : ASICs are custom-built for specific tasks, such as AI inferencing, making them highly efficient for those operations. In contrast, GPUs are more versatile and are designed to handle a variety of computational tasks, including graphics rendering and scientific computations. Performance and Efficiency : ASICs often deliver higher performance and greater power efficiency for specific AI tasks compared to GPUs. This is because ASICs eliminate unnecessary functionality, optimizing their architecture for particular AI algorithms. Flexibility : While GPUs offer greater flexibility and are suitable for a range of tasks, this comes at the cost of reduced efficiency for specific applications. ASICs, however, are not flexible but excel in the tasks they are designed for. Cost and Development Time : Developing ASICs requires more time and resources upfront due to the need for custom design and fabrication. GPUs, being mass-produced for a broader market, often come with lower individual costs and are readily available. Will ASICs Dethrone GPUs for LLM Inference ? (07/2024) In crypto mining, the initial reliance on GPUs and FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) gave way to the rise of ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) from China, which eventually took over due to their superior efficiency and performance for specific algorithms.

OAuth Introduction OAuth 2.0 (standardized in 2012) is a powerful and secure framework that allows different applications to securely interact with each other on behalf of users without sharing sensitive credentials. https://www.varonis.com/blog/what-is-oauth (06/2022) OAuth is an open-standard authorization protocol or framework that provides applications the ability for \u201csecure designated access.\u201d For example, you can tell Facebook that it\u2019s OK for ESPN.com to access your profile or post updates to your timeline without having to give ESPN your Facebook password. This minimizes risk in a major way: In the event ESPN suffers a breach, your Facebook password remains safe. OAuth doesn\u2019t share password data but instead uses authorization tokens to prove an identity between consumers and service providers. OAuth is an authentication protocol that allows you to approve one application interacting with another on your behalf without giving away your password. (...) The simplest example of OAuth in action is one website saying \u201chey, do you want to log into our website with other website\u2019s login?\u201d In this scenario, the only thing the first website \u2013 let\u2019s refer to that website as the consumer \u2013 wants to know is that the user is the same user on both websites and has logged in successfully to the service provider \u2013 which is the site the user initially logged into, not the consumer. Authentication vs authorization https://www.varonis.com/blog/what-is-oauth OAuth is about authorization and not authentication. Authorization is asking for permission to do stuff. Authentication is about proving you are the correct person because you know things. OAuth doesn\u2019t pass authentication data between consumers and service providers \u2013 but instead acts as an authorization token of sorts. OAuth entities The entities involved in OAuth are the User, the Server, and the Identity Provider (IDP). What Can an OAuth Token Do? When you use OAuth, you get an OAuth token that represents your identity and permissions. This token can do a few important things: Single Sign-On (SSO): With an OAuth token, you can log into multiple services or apps using just one login, making life easier and safer. Authorization Across Systems: The OAuth token allows you to share your authorization or access rights across various systems, so you don't have to log in separately everywhere. Accessing User Profile: Apps with an OAuth token can access certain parts of your user profile that you allow, but they won't see everything. SAML https://www.varonis.com/blog/what-is-saml Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an open standard that allows identity providers (IdP) to pass authorization credentials to service providers (SP). What that jargon means is that you can use one set of credentials to log into many different websites. It\u2019s much simpler to manage one login per user than it is to manage separate logins to email, customer relationship management (CRM) software, Active Directory, etc. OAuth vs SAML https://www.varonis.com/blog/what-is-oauth There are many differences between SAML and OAuth. SAML uses XML to pass messages, and OAuth uses JSON. OAuth provides a simpler mobile experience, while SAML is geared towards enterprise security. That last point is a key differentiator: OAuth uses API calls extensively, which is why mobile applications, modern web applications, game consoles, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices find OAuth a better experience for the user.

EUR \ud83d\ude35), but it is believed that it can cut production costs. \ud83d\udc49During gigacasting process, a molten liquid aluminum alloy is pressed into a mold under high pressure, resulting in the formation of large three-dimensional shapes with a relatively high level of precision. \ud83d\udc49A large single gigacasted component can replace 50, 70, or even more individual parts. \ud83d\udc49Gigacasting parts have also their disadvantages.
