# Rasterization

[What’s the Difference Between Ray Tracing and Rasterization?](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/whats-difference-between-ray-tracing-rasterization/) (Nvidia, 2018)
> With rasterization, objects on the screen are created from a mesh of virtual triangles, or polygons, that create 3D models of objects. In this virtual mesh, the corners of each triangle — known as vertices — intersect with the vertices of other triangles of different sizes and shapes. A lot of information is associated with each vertex, including its position in space, as well as information about color, texture and its “normal,” which is used to determine the way the surface of an object is facing.
> 
> Computers then convert the triangles of the 3D models into pixels, or dots, on a 2D screen. Each pixel can be assigned an initial color value from the data stored in the triangle vertices.
> 
> Further pixel processing or “shading,” including changing pixel color based on how lights in the scene hit the pixel, and applying one or more textures to the pixel, combine to generate the final color applied to a pixel.

> Ray tracing traces the path of a light ray through each pixel on a 2D viewing surface out into a 3D model of the scene
